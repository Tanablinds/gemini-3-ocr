Climate change refers to the variation in the global climate or climatic patterns in the long term. While sea level rise is undoubtedly a challenge, I believe that other challenges brought about by climate change such as extreme weather events and the spread of infectious insect-borne diseases are consequential as well."

    "reference_text": "Imagine a world where teens do not know how to communicate face-to-face — how would it be like? As social media gets more advanced, more and more people start to use it, especially teens. Social media is a platform that allows people to communicate with one another on the Internet. This means no need for hussles to walk all the way to a telephone post to call someone. There are many advantages and disadvantages to teens using social media to communicate. Teens can retrieve information on school work from their friend if they are absent from school, and they can get in touch with long-distance friends as well. However, this might lead to miscommunication and misunderstanding between one another at times, and teens might get distracted as well."

However, for coasts to managed best, coastal cities and towns need to consider other factors of hard and soft engineering in relation to their own situation in terms of, say, scale of impact or ease of implementation, on top of sustainability. It is best for people living near coastal areas to develop a blend of both hard and soft engineering methods to best suit the unique situation of their coasts."
